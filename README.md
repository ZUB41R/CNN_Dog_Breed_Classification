# CNN_Dog_Breed_Classification

This is the fourth project submitted as part of completing the [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t) by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). 

In this project, I have used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to prdict the breed of a dog. The architecture consists of 4 hidden layers, each of which is followed by batch normalization and has been trained on 6680 images of 133 dog breeds. The accuracy comes as 0.46 which does not seem good.

I also apply [transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning) from [ResNet-50](https://www.kaggle.com/keras/resnet50) which provides pretty good result with an accuracy of 0.83.
